# Introduction
This repo is an introduction to how you might go about getting your sensor data all the way from your sensor to AWS.<br>
AWS offers multiple ways to ingest and store data, but for sensor data it especially makes sense to look at the AWS IoT and streaming offerings. However, even here there are a lot of ways to go about doing the same thing and the nuances can get confusing. I did not find a great tutorial comparing different paths side by side, so I supposed that I would have to make it.<br>
